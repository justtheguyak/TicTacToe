## 📖 About The Project


This project is a visually engaging recreation of Tic Tac Toe built with vanilla web technologies. It moves away from the traditional pen-and-paper look, offering a glowing neon aesthetic, particle background effects, and fluid CSS animations.

It includes a robust state management system in JavaScript to handle game logic, win detection, and a CPU opponent that offers a challenge without being impossible to beat.

## ✨ Features

* **✨ Neon Aesthetic:** Glowing visuals, animated headers, and a futuristic color palette.
* **🤖 Smart Bot:** A "Play vs Bot" mode where the CPU blocks your moves and tries to win.
* **⚔️ PvP Mode:** Classic local multiplayer to play with a friend.
* **📏 Dynamic Winning Line:** A JavaScript-calculated line that draws smoothly and accurately across the winning cells, regardless of screen size.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **✨ Particle Background:** subtle, floating particle effects for immersion.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic markup and structure.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox/Grid for layout, keyframe animations for the neon glow and particle effects.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Game logic, DOM manipulation, Minimax-style bot logic, and dynamic coordinate calculation for the winning line.
